# Prompt 1
User: How can I fix the “npm ERR! Missing script: start” error in my project?
AI: The error appears because the "start" script is missing in package.json. You can use “npm run dev” instead or add "start": "vite" under the scripts section.

# Prompt 2
User: How do I open my website automatically when running the project?
AI: Add the “--open” flag to the Vite start command: "start": "vite --open". This will automatically launch the app in your browser.

# Prompt 3
User: What does “✖ Running 'npm run build'...” mean during Codespace setup?
AI: It’s a temporary message that appears when npm build runs before dependencies are ready. Since the container finished successfully, it’s safe to ignore unless you see red error lines.
